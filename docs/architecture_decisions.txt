# Justification for the modules design choice:

    1. Locations Api module and kafka locations: using REST Api with Kafka service queque to 
    enable the project to maintain large volumes of locations data.

    2. Connection Api module: using REST Api for better maintainability to be handled as a separate
    module

    3. Persons Api module: using REST Api to handle Persons services as another way to 
     satisfy different and future use cases

    4. Persons grpc module: using grpc to enble less latency  to enable fast loading when starting up 
    the app, integration with frontend and db is left for future implementations.


# Technologies used: 

    - Frontend development kept as it is by using react 
    - Backend development usin python and flask to satisfy the project requirements
    - Using Docker in packageing the apps.
